# Roadaccident
Developed a predictive model to forecast road accident severity in India using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, and XGBoost. Performed data preprocessing (null handling, feature selection, outlier removal) and visualized trends using bar plots, pie charts, violin plots, and heatmaps.
